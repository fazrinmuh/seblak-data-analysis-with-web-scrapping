# Situation:
I want to increase my income by selling products. However, I don't have enough capital for production and only enough for promotion, so I decide to run a dropshipping scheme on the Tokopedia platform. I'm still unsure about what to sell and remember that seblak is currently viral. However, I'm not sure if people really have a strong interest in seblak. As a data analyst, with my skills and knowledge, I want to analyze the sales of seblak products on Tokopedia. Do people like it? Are many buying it? Etc. The challenge is that I don't have any data except what is displayed on the Tokopedia e-commerce website. Therefore, my journey begins with data collection using web scraping!

# Complication:
Operating a dropshipping venture poses challenges that necessitate proficient data analysis abilities to identify trending and highly profitable goods, considering various influential factors. Initial observations indicate that the instant noodle snack 'seblak' enjoys considerable popularity among a wide range of age groups. Furthermore, the consumptive tendencies prevalent within Indonesian society, where consumption significantly drives the economy, contribute to the favorable opportunities and stable patterns associated with this product.

# Question:
Several questions are sought to be answered in this analysis process as follows:
- What are the potential minimum and maximum incomes achievable through dropshipping 'seblak'?
- Which locations are more likely to yield profitable incomes for stores?
- Is it obligatory to procure dropshipping products from stores with high ratings?

# Answer:
To answer the following questions, the steps I can take are to set problem-solving as a goal using the S.M.A.R.T. framework:
- **Specific:** Increasing revenue through selling seblak using the dropship scheme on the Tokopedia platform.
- **Measurable:** Measuring GMV values weekly/monthly and tracking the conversion from promotions to profits.
- **Achievable:** With the planned strategy, achieving a profit margin of up to 15% is a feasible goal.
- **Relevant:** Measuring GMV helps understand how much income is generated through the conversion process from promotions.
- **Time-bound:** The target must be achieved within the next 3 months to reach a profit margin of up to 15%.

# Findings and Conclusion:
After conducting a thorough analysis of seblak sales data through the Tokopedia platform, I drew some interesting and informative conclusions. Initially, the data collection process through web scraping encountered some challenges. Promotional ads appearing in the first three lines of each page posed an obstacle that needed to be overcome. However, with careful attention, I managed to overcome this issue and successfully collected data from 15 Tokopedia pages.

Subsequently, after the data was successfully collected, the next step was to prepare the data for further analysis. The raw data obtained required processing to make it easier to analyze. This process involved adjusting data types, handling missing values, and removing duplicate entries. After the data preparation process was completed, the remaining data totaled 121 entries, ready for further analysis.

One crucial aspect of the analysis was assessing the selling price of seblak. Although the average selling price reached Rp 24,824, it is important to note that there were significant outliers affecting this average. Therefore, the median price was considered more representative. The same applied to the analysis of seblak sales, where outliers affected the average value.

Furthermore, the data also indicated that the average rating of seblak stores was 4.7 out of a scale of 0-5. This indicates that seblak products receive positive feedback from customers, which is a good indication for business success.

After evaluating the potential minimum and maximum income from seblak sales, I found that the income could range from Rp 3,479,528 to Rp 11,053,361. This provides a clear picture of the income potential that can be obtained from this business.

Additionally, the analysis showed that there was no significant difference in product prices between the Jabodetabek and non-Jabodetabek areas. This provides flexibility in selecting suppliers, as prices do not significantly differ between regions.

From the correlation analysis between selling price and sales, it was found that the higher the selling price, the lower the sales volume. This indicates that selling price can significantly affect sales volume.

Lastly, based on the analysis to achieve a target profit of 15%, the recommended selling price was around Rp 17,250. With this strategy, I can target sales of 50 orders per week, with total revenue reaching Rp 10,350,000 in the next 3 months. With a 15% profit margin, the total income in 3 months could reach Rp 1,552,500.
